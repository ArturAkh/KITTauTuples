# KITTauTuples

A small repository, which processes CMS 2018 `TauTuples` produced with [TauMLTools](https://github.com/cms-tau-pog/TauMLTools) into a set of flat n-tuples
containing genuine &tau;<sub>h</sub> candidates, or jets, muons and electrons misidentified as &tau;<sub>h</sub> objects.

This repository is inspired by the setup of [CROWN](https://crown.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) analysis software.
